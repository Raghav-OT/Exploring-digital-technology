# Week 1
We learnt the basics of binary i.e. the conversion of arithematic to binary and vice versa. We also were given an assignnment to learn and understand mail merge and how to integrate an excel file into a mailing list so that each mail sent is personalized. We also did an outdoor assignment where we went outside and tried to find things that encorporate technology in it.
