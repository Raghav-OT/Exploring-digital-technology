# Week 2
We learned the basics of how computers work, the hardware that goes into the builiding of a very basic computer, we also learnt how to solve 1's and 2's complements, why 1's complement was not feasible and the origin of 2's complement. Using 2's complement we learnt how to convert binary to arithmatic and vice versa.
